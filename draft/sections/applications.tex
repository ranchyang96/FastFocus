\section{Applications}

Combined with the VR store visit project, \sysname provides better support for data collection.
It reduces the time when visitors need to take photos from stores.
With the cheap devices we already own, it greatly improves the quality of the photos instead of using videos from cheap sport cameras.

When we need to take a large amount of photos, \sysname greatly speed up the whole process.
In some special scenarios, when the object distance is relatively fixed, \sysname can be better applied while not using mechanice in the default hardware.
Cases include street view from the cross, store shelves photographing and museum virtual visits.
In these scenarios, \sysname helps a lot.
