Focusing is a fundamental step for taking pictures.
With currently available hardware in phones and existing focusing methods, it takes longer time to take pictures, especially when we need a large number of photos or faster photo delivery.
The current process does not consider the exact condition of the phones and the camera configurations they have.
Thus we present \sysname, a brandnew mechanism for faster focusing and image capturing which takes less time on both photo capturing and focus evaluation.
It collects the photos at specific focus positions in advance and then picks the most well-focused one as the result.
This saves time from traditional hill climbing by taking fewer pictures and calculates the focus function fewer times.
According to our experiments, \sysname has the average of 2.89s for collecting a well-focused photo, which is 39.7\% faster than hill climbing and the quality loss calculated from Laplacian focus function is less than 18\% in all cases.
